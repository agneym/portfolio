[Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/) is a tool for building web applications with less tooling and 10x faster iteration. Snowpack comes with a starter generator called [Create Snowpack App](https://github.com/pikapkg/create-snowpack-app), it has official plugins for most of the frameworks.

But what if we wanted to build a custom community plugin?

# Create Snowpack App (CSA)

You can use `create-snowpack-app` with:

```
npx create-snowpack-app dir-name --template template-name
```

You are excused if this feels familiar to [a popular react tool](https://create-react-app.dev/).

# Community Starter

A community starter is a repository that you get to maintain using Snowpack and published to NPM (or any of the other hosted services). You can initialise a new project using your template and CSA.

If your template is called `my-custom-template` and hosted to NPM, you would be able to use it with:

```
npx create-snowpack-app dir-name --template my-custom-template
```

First, we will start with a basic template:

```
npx create-snowpack-app my-custom-template --template @snowpack/app-template-blank
```

Now CSA will intialise a repository named `my-custom-template` that contains the snowpack template `@snowpack/app-template-blank`. Now you can proceed to make changes you want in the template.

_I'm just choosing to start with `blank`, you can choose to start with any other [template](https://www.snowpack.dev/#official-app-templates)_

## Add required fields

1. It needs a name

Give it a name in `package.json`, this is also your template name.

```json
{
  "name": "my-custom-template"
}
```

Note that this name needs to be unique in the NPM package registry. You can also scope it to something like `@npmuser@my-custom-template`, these are known as [scoped packages](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-scopes).

2. It needs a version

Give it a version.

```json
{
  "version": "0.0.1"
}
```

3. Add the keyword.

CSA requires the template to have a specific keyword: `csa-template`.

```json
{
  "keywords": ["csa-template"]
}
```

## Publishing package to NPM

There are several articles and videos if you are not familar with publishing or haven't done this before. But the basic idea is:

```bash
npm login
npm publish
```

You can also use one of the several tools that help with this process. One of my absolute favorites is [np](https://www.npmjs.com/package/np).

## Using the template

You can now use the template as mentioned with:

```
npx create-snowpack-app dir-name --template my-custom-template
```

Have fun 🎉
