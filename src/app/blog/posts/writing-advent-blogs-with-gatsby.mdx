The Advent has officially began and it's time for some advent blog posts.

I made a [GatsbyJS theme](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/themes/what-are-gatsby-themes/) to help you get started on the #Trend.

Source: https://github.com/agneym/gatsby-theme-advent

# Installation

```bash
npm i @agney/gatsby-theme-advent

# OR #

yarn add @agney/gatsby-theme-advent
```

You can start using it by adding it to the `gatsby-config.js` file:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: `@agney/gatsby-theme-advent`,
      options: {
        contentPath: "src/content",
        assetPath: "src/assets",
        basePath: "/december", // Tell the theme which URL to render the theme at.
      },
    },
  ],
};
```

The `contentPath` defines where your markdown files are hosted, there has to be at least a markdown file when you get started.

Markdown files with following `frontmatter` are supported:

```
---
title: "This is the first advent gift"
date: "2019-12-01T22:12:03.284Z"
published: true
---
```

The `assetPath` refers to the path to directory where the theme can pick up the cover image from. Currently, you can add an image named `cover.jpg` at this directory and it will be passed through `gatsby-plugin-sharp` and appear as your cover image.

The `basePath` is the path to render the advent page on. You can use "" or leave it out to have it render on the main page.
