A toast notification is a long standing custom in mobile application used to notify the user of something happening within the system. Sometimes it even has buttons for interaction.

Here is how to use one (straight from the docs):

```typescript
function ToastExample: FC = () => {
  const [showToast, setShowToast] = useState(false);
  return (
    <IonToast
      isOpen={showToast}
      onDidDismiss={() => setShowToast(false)}
      message="Your settings have been saved."
      duration={200}
    />
  )
}
```

Well, this is easy 😁I can do that.

But I normally thinks of toasts more imperatively than this. It might be because of libraries like `react-toast` or `ant.design` who have these imperative toast messaging systems, or it could even be that Ionic's own Angular part of design has an imperative toast.

Also, if I needed to a success toast and an error toast, I would need multiple `IonToast` components rendered or have states definining toast state.

In Angular Ionic, you would:

```typescript
const toast = this.toastController.create({
  message: "",
});
toast.present();
```

That's pretty cool 😎. What if we could do this?

We could utilise a [React Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) and a hook to achieve this functionality at with ease. I wrote out a custom package which does exactly that.

```typescript
// Wrap you App.tsx with ToastProvider
const App: FC = () => {
  <IonApp>
    <ToastProvider>
      // ...rest of your application
    </ToastProvider>
  </IonApp>
}

// In your component
const RegisterForm: FC () => {
  const Toast = useToast();
  // ...

  function validate() {
    const toast = Toast.warning('Passwords don\'t match');
  }

  function submit(data) {
    try {
      const response = await api.register(data);
      Toast.success('Registration Successful');
    } catch() {
      Toast.error('Request failed');
    }
  }
}
```

This allows you have to have error messages with a one liner:

```
Toast.error('Error message');
```

The `ToastProvider` also takes a `value` property that allows you to define defaults for all toasts created in it's children.

The package also enables creating toast messages with the same Angular API as:

```typescript
function Component: FC = () => {
  const Toast = useToast();

  const handleClick = () => {
    const toast = Toast.create({ message: 'thing' });
    toast.present();
    // When you want to.
    toast.dismiss();
    ...
  }

  // ...
}
```

To install the package:

```bash
npm i @agney/ir-toast
```

Note that it has a dependency on both React and Ionic React.
