There comes a time when we want to add more fields/elements into an array or object when it satisfies a certain condition. This blog is an exploration of how and why.

## Spreading into an Array

`isWinter` is a boolean variable and you need to add `winterEssentials` if it's true and nothing otherwise.

<Playground
  defaultEditorTab="javascript"
  defaultResultTab="console"
  initialSnippet={{
    markup: ``,
    css: ``,
    javascript: `const essentials = ['phones', 'book', 'cap'];
const winterEssentials = ['sweater', 'thermals'];
 
const isWinter = true;
 
const tripEssentials = [
  ...essentials,
  ...(isWinter ? winterEssentials : [])
];`,
  }}
/>

We need an empty array at end because we cannot spread `undefined` or `null` into an array (they are not iterables). Spreading an empty array into another just keeps the array intact.

```javascript
const initialArray = ["a", "b", "c"];
const resultingArray = [...initialArray, ...[]];
console.log(initialArray, resultingArray); // Have the same elements.
```

## Spreading into an Object

Rest spread into object is a [Stage 4 ECMA proposal](https://tc39.es/proposal-object-rest-spread) and is [implemented in most browsers](https://caniuse.com/#feat=mdn-javascript_operators_spread_spread_in_object_literals).

It mimics the behavior of existing [Object.assign](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign) operator.

<Playground
  defaultEditorTab="javascript"
  initialSnippet={{
    markup: ``,
    css: ``,
    javascript: `const hacker = {
  hoodie: true,
}
 
const isHacker = true;
 
const person = {
  firstName: '',
  lastName: '',
  ...(isHacker && hacker)
};
 
console.log(person);`,
  }}
/>

You will notice here that resorting to a conditional operator isn't necessary. This is because rest spread for objects tries to wrap any primitive it finds to an object.

```javascript
console.log(null); // {}
console.log(undefined); // {}
console.log(0); // {}
console.log("abc"); // {0: "a", 1: "b", 2: "c"}, well an array is also an object
```

So the expression `(isHacker && hacker)` returns `undefined` which our spread operator converts to `{}` and spreading an empty array into an object results in nothing.

That's conditional spread.
