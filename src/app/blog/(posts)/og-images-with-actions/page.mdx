Open graph images are those that show up on your social media card when you share the URL.

Here is how to add one:

```html
<meta property="og:image" content="http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/rock.jpg" />
```

Simple, Right?

Now for comparison here are two tweets:

<Image
  src={withoutOg}
  alt="Without an open graph image - bland"
  style={{ objectFit: "contain", width: "80%" }}
/>

I think we can all agree that this is pretty bland.

Now let's look at another one, but now with the Open Graph Image.

<Image
  src={withOg}
  alt="With open graph - much better"
  style={{ objectFit: "contain", width: "80%" }}
/>

Much better.

But moving to photoshop for creating this image is pretty hard, it's mostly generic anyway.

# Github Actions to the rescue

[Install from Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/generate-og-image)

[Generate OG Image](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/generate-og-image) is a customisable open graph image generator that runs on Github Actions which means it is free for public repositories.

You can add it to your existing workflow by adding the following lines to your `action.yml`:

```yml
name: "Generate OG Images"
on: pull_request

jobs:
  generate_og_job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Generate OG Images
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - name: Generate Image
        uses: agneym/generate-og-image@1.0.3
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          GITHUB_CONTEXT: ${{ toJson(github) }}
        with:
          path: static/post-images/
```

Steps to note here:

1. It needs the `GITHUB_TOKEN` so it can access the markdown files and commit the generated image.
2. `GITHUB_CONTEXT` gives more information pull request.
3. `actions/checkout@v1` allows to access the files inside the action.
4. `path` refers to the required path.
