PS: This assumes that you already know why you want to use Elastic Beanstalk and CircleCI.

Planned Workflow:

<img
  src={diagram}
  alt="Flow from Local to CI to EB"
  style={{ "object-fit": "contain", width: "100%" }}
/>

1. We create the application locally in different branches.
2. We merge to `master` branch.
3. CircleCI runs lint and test on these branches.
4. CircleCI runs the NextJS build. (Also, run custom server build if you have one)
5. CircleCI creates a ZIP file with necessary folders and pushed it to Elastic Beanstalk.
6. Elastic Beanstalk runs the build and application is deployed.

So, let's start.

## Setup EB Environment

1. Create New Application
2. Create New Environment
3. When it asks you over two choices, choose Create a Web Server.
4. Configure the rest of the server, you would probably want a load balancer in there if you want to [setup HTTPS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/configuring-https.html).

## Setup CircleCI

1. Create a CircleCI application
2. Link it to your repository on Github/Gitlab and select your technology.
3. We have NodeJS here and our configuration script being:

```
version: 2
jobs:
  test:
    docker:
      -
        image: 'circleci/node:10.8.0'
    working_directory: ~/app-name-directory
    steps:
      - checkout
      -
        restore_cache:
          name: Restore Yarn Package Cache
          keys:
            - yarn-packages-{{ checksum "yarn.lock" }}
      -
        run: 'yarn install'
      -
        save_cache:
          name: Save Yarn Package Cache
          key: 'yarn-packages-{{ checksum "yarn.lock" }}'
          paths:
            - ~/.cache/yarn
      -
        run: 'yarn test'
  deploy_prod:
    working_directory: ~/app-name-directory
    docker:
      -
        image: 'circleci/node:10.8.0'
    steps:
      - checkout
      -
        run:
          name: 'Build Application'
          command: yarn install && yarn run build && yarn run generate-zip
      -
        run:
          name: 'Install Python'
          command: "sudo apt-get -y -qq update\nsudo apt-get -y -qq install python3.4-dev\necho 'export PATH=/root/.local/bin/:$PATH' >> $BASH_ENV\necho 'export PATH=/home/circleci/.local/bin/:$PATH' >> $BASH_ENV\n"
      -
        run:
          name: 'Install pip'
          command: "curl -O https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py\npython3.4 get-pip.py --user\n"
      -
        run:
          name: 'Install AWS EB CLI & S3 CLI'
          command: "pip install awsebcli --upgrade --user\npip install awscli --upgrade --user\n"
      -
        run:
          name: 'Deploy to Elastic Beanstalk'
          command: "eb use AppName-env\ntimeout 1m eb deploy -v --staged || true\n"
workflows:
  version: 2
  Test_and_Deploy:
    jobs:
      - test
      -
        deploy_prod:
          requires:
            - test
          filters:
            branches:
              only: master
```

This configuration runs in `yarn test` on all branches pushed. It runs `deploy_prod` only on the `master` branch, after running `test` successfully.

```
eb use AppName-env\ntimeout 1m eb deploy -v --staged
```

In this command, use the name you provided to your environment earlier in Elastic Beanstalk.

## Create IAM user

Now we have to provide permissions for Circle CI to deploy to Elastic Beanstalk. This is done with the help of AWS IAM User.

1. [Add a AWS User from here](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/users$new?step=details)
2. Set a username and select Programmatic access as the Access type
3. Click 'Create group' on the user permissions page
4. Set a group name and search for the AWSElasticBeanstalkFullAccess policy type and select it
5. Create the group so it's assigned to your new user
6. Review and create the user.

## Add IAM User to CircleCI

Add deployment user environment variables to CircleCi

- Project Settings > Environment Variables
  - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
  - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

## Deploying NextJS

Now, is the tricky part. You do not want to transfer every part of your application to Elasticbeanstalk. Instead, you might want to transfer the `.next` folder that houses your build and may be a [custom server combination](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/examples/custom-server-express) you are using with it.

Elastic Beanstalk very essentially works with a ZIP file being uploaded to the service. This is what happens when you use the CI with the command `eb deploy`, but here what we want to do is create a custom ZIP file for EB and ask it to deploy the same.

```
yarn run generate-zip
```

This is what this line in our CircleCI configuration is doing.

```
"generate-zip": "sh ./scripts/generate-zip.sh"
```

`generate-zip` command in our `package.json` points to an `sh` file that is to be executed after taking build of your application.

Here is the `generate-zip.sh` file:

```
# If the directory, `dist`, doesn't exist, create `dist`
stat dist || mkdir dist
# Archive artifacts
zip dist/$npm_package_name.zip -r dist .next package.json yarn.lock next.config.js assets
```

This creates a ZIP in the dist folder with `.next`, `package.json`, `lock` files, config scripts and assets. If you have a custom server being build somewhere, add that folder name too. In my case, it is being build to `dist` folder itself.

Now, we need to ask EB to actually use this zip file. We do that with `.elasticbeanstalk/config.yml` file.

```
branch-defaults:
  master:
    environment: AppName-env
global:
  application_name: app-name
  default_ec2_keyname: app-web
  default_platform: Node.js
  default_region: ap-south-1
  include_git_submodules: true
  instance_profile: null
  platform_name: null
  platform_version: null
  profile: null
  sc: git
  workspace_type: Application
deploy:
  artifact: dist/appname.zip
```

Note: Use the same names you used while creating the environment here too.

The last line is the major part to take notice. This is the ZIP we made with the `sh` file in last step.

Now, just push the master branch and it should build the application on EB.
