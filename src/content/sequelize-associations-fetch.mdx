This blog exclusively deals with how to fetch associations in sequelize. Primary knowledge of NodeJS, Express and SequelizeJS is recommended.

[Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/) is an Object relational library (ORM) that helps to communicate between database (Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite and Microsoft SQL Server) and programming models on the NodeJS end.

Refer to [Part 1 - Creating Associations](/sequelize-associations/) for a tutorial on how to create associations.

## Associations Recap

There are three main types of associations that can be represented in Sequelize:

- One to One relationship
- One to Many relationship
- Many to Many relationship

All three of these are fetched with similar semantics.

## Fetch techniques

Sequlize offers two different ways to fetch associations of a model. These are:

- Eager Loading
- Lazy loading

### Eager Loading

This technique is most used to fetch associations. Eager loading loads the associations and related models in a single request. To eager load, we can use `include` property in `find` clause.

To fetch `User` with `Profile` information:

```javascript
const user = User.find({
  include: {
    model: Profile,
  },
});
```

If `User` has `Profile` information, this will return data of the form:

```javascript
{
  ...userProperties,
  "profile": {
    ...profileProperties,
  }
}
```

Note that `profile` is singular because they share a 1-1 relationship.

**How do we select attributes to be returned?**

Just like the normal `find` command, the `include` can have an `attributes` array including column names to be returned.

```javascript
const user = User.find({
  include: {
    model: Profile,
    attributes: ["firstName", "lastName"], // return only these columns
  },
});
```

**What if we need to go deeper? How do we fetch the Location model connected to Profile?**

Let's nest it.

```javascript
const user = User.find({
  include: {
    model: Profile,
    include: {
      model: Location,
    },
  },
});
```

**What if we need a where clause on the association?**

A `where` clause, you say.

```javascript
const user = User.find({
  include: {
    model: Profile,
    where: {
      age: {
        [Op.gt]: 18,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

**How to fetch only the users with profiles?**

Sequlize uses _Outer Joins_ by default. To turn it into an Inner Join (only if the associated model is also present):

```javascript
const user = User.find({
  include: {
    model: Profile,
    required: true,
  },
});
```

Note that the `where` clause that we specified in the last example automatically turns the query into an inner join.

**What if it's not a 1-1 relationship?**

The plurality changes. The syntax remains the same, but the result with have a plural version of key name.

```javascript
const userWithComments = User.find({
  include: {
    model: Comment,
  },
});
```

will result in:

```javascript
{
  ...userProperties,
  "comments": [{
    ...commentProperties,
  }],
}
```

**My association is aliased. How do I specify the alias?**

You can specify the alias with `as` keyword, similar to how you define it.

```javascript
const userWithFavBooks = User.find({
  include: {
    model: Book,
    as: "FavBooks",
  },
});
```

**How to get the junction table in case of Many-Many association?**

The junction table is automatically fetched by Sequelize when you fetch a Many-Many association.

You can apply other properties we mentioned like `where` clause using the `through` key.

```javascript
const userWithFavBooks = User.find({
  include: {
    model: Book,
    as: "FavBooks",
    through: {
      where: {
        rating: {
          [Op.gt]: 3,
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

**Can we fetch multiple associations at once?**

Sure, let's turn `include` into an array.

```javascript
const user = User.find({
  include: [
    {
      model: Profile,
    },
    {
      model: Comment,
    },
  ],
});
```

### Lazy Loading

Lazy Loading makes use of Sequelize's ability to add functions to Models with it's associations.

For eg. If `User` and `Profile` are connected with 1-1 association, Sequelize automatically adds a function called `getProfile` to `User` and `getUser` to `Profile` (There are several functions like this, `addProfile`, `updateProfile` etc.)

```javascript
const user = User.findOne({
  where: {
    id: 1,
  },
});
let profile = null;
if (user.active) {
  profile = user.getProfile();
}
```

Note that it makes two database requests here, but the `Profile` information is fetched only if `User` found is active.

There is a lot more to cover on creating these relationships like customising keys or changing how update or delete affects these relationships. I do plan to cover them, but [documentation](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/assocs.html) should be your best guide if you understand these relationships better.

Have fun ðŸŽ‰
