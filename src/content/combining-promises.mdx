It is quite common during web development that we run across scenarios where we have to orchestrate different asynchronous operations together. This blog describes ways in which we can combine Promises, our default async operation strategy and their applications.

## Terminology

<p>
<details>
  <summary>Promise</summary>
  An object representing the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation, and its resulting value.

You can create a promise with:

```javascript
const promise = new Promise((resolveCallback, rejectCallback) => {
  // Operation
});
```

You can get result of a promise with:

```javascript
promise.then(
  (resolvedResult) => {
    // This function is called if promise is resolved.
  },
  (rejectionReason) => {
    // This function is called if promise is rejected.
  },
);
```

A Promise is also a guarantee of an asychronous operation, any operation that is wrapped in a Promise will only be resolved or rejected only by the next clock tick.

</details>
</p>

A promise can be of three different states:

1. Pending - meaning that it's still in flight.
2. Fulfilled - operation has completed successfully.
3. Rejected - operation has failed.

A promise that is either Fulfilled or Rejected is said to be _settled_.

## Combinators

All of the combinators take an array of Promises as argument.

### Promise.all

This is the most widely used among the combinators. Here is how we can use it:

```javascript
Promise.all([promiseA, promiseB]).then(
  ([promiseAResponse, promiseBResponse]) => {
    // Do something with it here
  },
);
```

`Promise.all` is fulfilled if **all** promises that are provided to it are fulfilled or if **one** of the promises is rejected.

### Promise.race

```javascript
Promise.race([promiseA, promiseB]).then(
  ([promiseAResponse, promiseBResponse]) => {
    // Do something with it here
  },
);
```

`Promise.race` is fulfilled when **one** of the promises is settled (fulfilled or rejected).

### Promise.allSettled

```javascript
Promise.allSettled([promiseA, promiseB]).then(
  ([promiseAResponse, promiseBResponse]) => {
    // Do something with it here
  },
);
```

Returns when all promises are settled (fulfilled or rejected).
