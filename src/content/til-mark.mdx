From series - Today I learned. There is a tag in HTML that helps us highlight stuff just using it. And too many times I have used `span`s with a highlight class, Damn it!

Let's look at what the `mark` tag brings in and how to use it.

<Playground
  id="mark-intro"
  initialSnippet={{
    markup: `<p>This is a long text that I want you to look very <mark>closely</mark> at</p>`,
    css: ``,
    javascript: ``,
  }}
/>

Just embed mark where you want the highlight and you are good to go.

#### Where do we use this?

1. Do you want to highlight the most relevant parts of a paragraph? Use `mark`.
2. Do you want to highlight the term user searched for? Use `mark`
3. Want to try syntax highlighting? Don't do `mark`, Use a [library](https://prismjs.com/).
4. Want to highlight the most important part in a paragraph? Don't use `mark`, use `strong`.
