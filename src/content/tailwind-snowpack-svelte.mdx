[Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/) is a tool for building web applications with less tooling and 10x faster iteration. [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is a utility-first CSS framework for
rapidly building custom designs. Let's explore how to combine both of them. [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) is a radical new approach to building user interfaces.

This article talks about how to use them in combination. This will also interest you if you want to add `svelte-preprocess` when using a Snowpack app.

# Template

Premade template is available on [Github](https://github.com/agneym/svelte-tailwind-snowpack). You can use the template with command:

```bash
npx create-snowpack-app dir-name --template @snowpack/app-template-svelte
```

## Setup Svelte and Snowpack

Snowpack provides an official template for svelte that can be initialised with:

```bash
npx create-snowpack-app dir-name --template svelte-tailwind-snowpack
```

[Template Source](https://github.com/pikapkg/create-snowpack-app/tree/master/templates/app-template-svelte)

## Svelte Preprocess

If you wanted to add PostCSS to your Svelte application, [`svelte-preprocess`](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte-preprocess) would probably be the plugin you think of. It functions as an automatic processor for PostCSS, SCSS, Less and a lot more.

But since we are using Snowpack's custom plugin, none of the usual loaders would work. Luckily, snowpack plugin has a secret hatch to push in plugins. It's a config file named `svelte.config.js`. You can create one in your root folder and export your pre-processor.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  preprocess: () => console.log("Preprocess Script"),
};
```

To add `svelte-preprocess`, you would need to install it with:

```bash
npm i svelte-preprocess
```

Modify the `svelte-config.js` with:

```javascript
const sveltePreprocess = require("svelte-preprocess");

const preprocess = sveltePreprocess({
  // options to preprocess here
});

module.exports = {
  preprocess,
};
```

## Configuring PostCSS

As [suggested on Tailwind docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation), we will use Tailwind CSS with PostCSS. To add this to preprocess:

```javascript
const sveltePreprocess = require("svelte-preprocess");

const preprocess = sveltePreprocess({
  postcss: {
    plugins: [
      // Plugins go in here.
    ],
  },
});

module.exports = {
  preprocess,
};
```

## Adding Tailwind

Tailwind is available as a PostCSS plugin, you can add it with:

```javascript
const sveltePreprocess = require("svelte-preprocess");

const preprocess = sveltePreprocess({
  postcss: {
    plugins: [require("tailwindcss")],
  },
});

module.exports = {
  preprocess,
};
```

After installing `tailwindcss` package ofcourse.

and you are good to go. You can find the complete template on Github:

It is also listed on the page for community templates on Snowpack website.
