As JavaScript developers, NPM is something that we always use and we have a script continously running on the terminal.

What if we could save some time using it?

## 1. Open documentation directly from npm

What if we could directly jump to the documentation of a package from using `npm`?

```bash
npm home package-name

# for example:

npm home react  # would take you to reactjs.org in the browser/
```

## 2. Open the bugs 🐛 page

Just in case, we wanted to file a bug on the package.

```bash
npm bugs package-name

# for example:
npm bugs @agney/playground
```

This would open the github issues page (or any issues page) in the browser if linked by the package author.

## 3. See all scripts in your package.

It's hard to remember script names esp. if you did not write them in the first place. Instead of going to `package.json`, you can run the following command to see script names and commands being run.

```bash
npm run
```

## 4. Skip all the init questions

When you run `npm init`, it asks you a number of questions. You can go ahead and answer all of them, but it's much better to skip and accept the default for most of the time.

```bash
npm init -yes
```

## 5. Updating packages to latest.

The default command for NPM CLI would only update the packages respecting the semver range specified in `package.json`.

```bash
npm update
```

However, I don't think we believe in package authors or ourselves to change the semver indicators. `yarn` provides a nice enough utility with `yarn upgrade-interactive --latest`, but it's not available for NPM.

To clone this functionality with NPM, you can use a package named [`npm-check`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check).

```
npx npm-check --update
```

## 6. Faster npm install on CI

`npm install` comes with some baggage (user oriented features) that makes it inherently slow. But we do need these on the CI server, NPM allows us to skip these with a command.

```bash
npm ci
```

You can add replace the `npm install` with `npm ci` in your CI servers and do fine if you have a `package-lock.json`.

For example, [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) configuration would be:

```
# .travis.yml
install:
- npm ci
# keep the npm cache around to speed up installs
cache:
  directories:
  - "$HOME/.npm"
```

## 7. A Better npm publish

`npm publish`is good, it can update your package version with semver and then push the package onto the registry.

But this does leave out some of the important steps: Building and testing the package. To automate these to be performed, you can use the `prepublish` script.

```json
"scripts": {
    "prepublish": "npm run build"
}
```

But `prepublish` is executed on each `install` and hence not the best place to create changelogs or run your tests. After taking some criticism on the naming (it's one of the hardest things anyway), NPM introduced some a new automatic hook `prepublishOnly`

```json
"scripts": {
    "prepublishOnly": "npm test"
}
```

Or, better is the package [`np`](https://github.com/sindresorhus/np).

You can simply run:

```
npx np
```

and it will run all the necessary steps including installing packages, build and running the tests. It will also create a tag and release on Github 💌.
