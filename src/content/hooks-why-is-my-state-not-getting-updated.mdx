Probably because you are using it wrong.

```js
const [value, setValue] = useState("");
function handleChange(newValue) {
  setValue(newValue);
  console.log(value);
}
```

Why is your state not getting updated?

Straight out of [React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html#state-updates-may-be-asynchronous), `setState` may be asynchronous. What does that mean?

Letâ€™s find out.

```js
setTimeout(() => console.log("foo"), 0);
console.log("bar");
```

What is the output?

First the second `console.log` fires and then the first one inside the `setTimeout` function. This happens because `setTimeout` is asynchronous and is moved to the browser thread. So the code that runs after `setTimeout` gets executed however small the timeout is.

Same is the case with `setState` Because of itâ€™s asynchronous state, the statement after is being called before the actual `setState` function.

# How do we fix this?

React calls the functional component once again whenever the state is updated. Hence, to see the updated state, just look in the render.

```js
function App() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState("");
  function handleChange(newValue) {
    setValue(newValue);
  }
  console.log(value);
  ...
}
```

But in real world react components, there would be multiple states (and props) and this would trigger the `console.log` every time any one of these is updated. Instead, a more effective approach would be:

```js
function App() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState("");
  useEffect(() => {
    console.log(value);
  }, [value]);
  function handleChange(newValue) {
    setValue(newValue);
  }
  ...
}
```

Note that the `useEffect` has the required state as dependency and thus would run whenever it is changed.
