`Children.count()` and `Children.toArray().length` have different outputs. We are going to explore how and why.

Consider a React component:

```javascript
function Wrapper({ children }) {
  const count = Children.count(children);
  const countArray = Children.toArray(children).length;
  return (
    <section>
      <p>
        <pre>Children.count:</pre>
        {count}
      </p>
      <p>
        <pre>Children.toArray:</pre>
        {countArray}
      </p>
      {children}
    </section>
  );
}

export default Wrapper;
```

Now, to render this component we are giving it:

```javascript
<Wrapper>
  <h1>Hello CodeSandbox</h1>
  <h2>Start editing to see some magic happen!</h2>
</Wrapper>
```

Now, both counts listed in the UI would point to 2. What about if we change the Wrapper children to:

```javascript
<Wrapper>
  <h1>Hello CodeSandbox</h1>
  {false && <h2>Start editing to see some magic happen!</h2>}
</Wrapper>
```

Now, `Children.count` will report 2 while `Children.toArray().length` will report 1.

This is because `Children.count` is counting the number of slots that children has. Whether it be `false`, `null` or `undefined`, it's still a slot and `Children.count` does a good job of counting it. From the docs:

> number of times that a callback passed to `map` or `forEach` would be invoked.

`Children.toArray` on the other hand, converts Children it receives to an opaque structure containing only the elements that JSX can render. That's how it reports that there is only a single child inside `Wrapper`, the other one is conditionally false.

You often see people try to weed out invalid children using this property. For eg. [Chakra UI](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui/blob/master/packages/utils/src/react-helpers.ts#L49-L59)

```javascript
/**
 * Gets only the valid children of a component,
 * and ignores any nullish or falsy child.
 *
 * @param children the children
 */
export function getValidChildren(children: React.ReactNode) {
  return React.Children.toArray(children).filter((child) =>
    React.isValidElement(child),
  ) as React.ReactElement[]
}
```

Here's a `Children.count` usage example from [Ant Design](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/blob/7212a9746d9f21933fda26cac21f81604da3738b/components/carousel/index.tsx#L52-L56):

```javascript
componentDidUpdate(prevProps: CarouselProps) {
  // If the number of Children (even if something was conditionally rendered) has changed, then go to the first slide.
  if (React.Children.count(this.props.children) !== React.Children.count(prevProps.children)) {
    this.goTo(this.props.initialSlide || 0, false);
  }
}
```

Have fun 🎉
