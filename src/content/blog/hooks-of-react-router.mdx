React Router 5 embraces the power of [hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) and has introduces four different hooks to help with your routing.

But before we look at hooks themselves, we have to look at a new pattern that the `Route` component exposes and how this changes things.

_Before_:

```javascript
// When you wanted to render the route and get router props for component
<Route path="/" component={Home} />
// Or when you wanted to pass extra props
<Route path="/" render={({ match }) => <Profile match={match} mine={true} />}>
```

When using the `component` syntax, route props (match, location and history) are implicitly being passed on to the component. But it has to be changed to `render` once you have extra props to pass to the component. Note that adding a function to the `component` syntax would lead to the component re-mounting on every render.

_After_:

```javascript
<Route path="/">
  <Home />
</Route>
```

Note that there is no implicit passing of any props to the `Home` component. But without changing anything with the `Route` itself, you can add any extra props to the `Home` component. You can no longer make the mistake of re-mounting the component on every render and that's the best kind of APIs.

But now that implicit passing of route props is not there, how do we access `match`, `history` or `location`? Do we have to wrap all components with `withRouter`? That is where the hooks steps in.

> Note that hooks were introduced in 16.8 version of React, so you need to be above that version to use them.

## `useHistory`

- Provides access to the `history` prop in React Router
- Refers to [history package](https://github.com/ReactTraining/history) dependency that the router uses
- Primary use case would be for programmatic routing with functions like `push`, `replace` etc

```javascript
function Home() {
  const history = useHistory();
  return <button onClick={() => history.push("/profile")}>Profile</button>;
}
```

## `useLocation`

- Provides access to the `location` prop in React Router
- It is similar to the `window.location` in the browser itself, but this is accessible everywhere as it represents the Router state and location.
- Primary use case for this would be to access the query params or the complete route string.

```javascript
function Profile() {
  const location = useLocation();
  useEffect(() => {
    const currentPath = location.pathname;
    const searchParams = new URLSearchParams(location.search);
  }, [location]);
  return <p>Profile</p>;
}
```

> Since location property is immutable, the `useEffect` will call the function everytime the route changes, making it perfect to operate on search parameters or current path.

## `useParams`

- Provides access to search parameters in the URL.
- This was possible earlier only using `match.params`

```javascript
function Profile() {
  const { name } = useParams();
  return <p>{name}'s Profile</p>;
}

function Dashboard() {
  return (
    <>
      <nav>
        <Link to={`/profile/ann`}>Ann's Profile</Link>
      </nav>
      <main>
        <Route path="/profile/:name">
          <Profile />
        </Route>
      </main>
    </>
  );
}
```

## `useRouteMatch`

- Provides access to the [match](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/match) object.
- If provided with no arguments, it returns the closest match in the component or it's parents.
- Primary use case would be to construct nested paths.

```javascript
function Auth() {
  const match = useRouteMatch();
  return (
    <>
      <Route path={`${match.url}/login`}>
        <Login />
      </Route>
      <Route path={`${match.url}/register`}>
        <Register />
      </Route>
    </>
  );
}
```

You can also use `useRouteMatch` to access a match without rendering a `Route`, this is done by passing it the location argument.

For example, consider that you need your own profile to be rendered at `/profile` and somebody else's profile if the URL contains the name of the person `/profile/dan` or `/profile/ann`. Without using the hook, you would either write a [`Switch`](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/Switch) and list down both routes and customise them with props, now using the hook:

```javascript
import {
  Route,
  BrowserRouter as Router,
  Link,
  useRouteMatch,
} from "react-router-dom";

function Profile() {
  const match = useRouteMatch("/profile/:name");

  return match ? <p>{match.params.name}'s Profile</p> : <p>My own profile</p>;
}

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <nav>
        <Link to="/profile">My Profile</Link>
        <br />
        <Link to={`/profile/ann`}>Ann's Profile</Link>
      </nav>
      <Route path="/profile">
        <Profile />
      </Route>
    </Router>
  );
}
```

> You can also use all the props on `Route` like `exact` or `sensitive` as an object with `useRouteMatch`.

Using the hooks and the technique we mentioned in the beginning with `Route` would make it much easier to upgrade to new versions of React Router.
