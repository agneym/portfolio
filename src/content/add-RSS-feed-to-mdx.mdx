Google Reader might be dead, but RSS lives through the hearts of some great applications like [Feedly](http://feedly.com/), [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com/) and [Winds](https://winds.getstream.io/).

Adding an RSS Feed has long been a long time bucket list item and I'm happy to have ticked it off. You can now add an RSS Feed and subscribe to my posts at [https://blog.agney.dev/rss.xml](https://blog.agney.dev/rss.xml).

Here's how you can do it too:

The first step on the Gatsby site is to install `gatsby-plugin-feed`.

```
yarn add gatsby-plugin-feed

// OR

npm i gatsby-plugin-feed
```

Second, let's look at adding the plugin to `gatsby-config.js`:

```javascript
  {
    resolve: `gatsby-plugin-feed`,
    options: {
      query: `
        {
          site {
            siteMetadata {
              title
              description
              siteUrl
            }
          }
        }
      `,
      feeds: [
        {
          serialize: ({ query: { site, allMdx } }) => {
            return allMdx.edges.map(edge => {
              return Object.assign({}, edge.node.frontmatter, {
                description: edge.node.excerpt,
                data: edge.node.frontmatter.date,
                url: site.siteMetadata.siteUrl + edge.node.fields.slug,
                guid: site.siteMetadata.siteUrl + edge.node.fields.slug,
                custom_elements: [{ 'content:encoded': edge.node.html }],
              });
            });
          },
          query: `
          {
            allMdx(
              limit: 1000,
              sort: { order: DESC, fields: [frontmatter___date] },
              filter: { frontmatter: { published: { ne: false } } }
            ) {
              edges {
                node {
                  fields { slug }
                  frontmatter {
                    title
                    date
                  }
                  html
                }
              }
            }
          }
          `,
          output: '/rss.xml',
          title: `Mindless - Agney's Technical Blog RSS Feed`,
          site_url: `https://blog.agney.dev`,
        },
      ],
    },
  },
```

Let's look at the options one by one.

1. The first query attribute let's us query for site level attributes like `siteMetadata`. This data is important to construct `siteUrl` and `guid`s.

2. We had a `feeds` array. This is an array so that you can create multiple feeds. For example, one for your blog and another for your podcast. Just seperate them into two objects.

3. Inside `feeds` array, we have our feed object. This defines all the options for our RSS Feed. Because we have a MDX Blog, we need a custom serializer to transform pages into HTML objects that the RSS Feed readers understand.

4. `query` field inside this object stands for graphql query that retrieves all the pages in the blog. Note to add the `published` filter if you use this format to hide drafts.

5. `gatsby-plugin-mdx` exposes an `html` field for the purpose of building RSS blogs. But because the process is expensive, it is not build on development. This is passed on to the `custom_elements` field in serializer. You can find all available options in [docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-feed/).

To see the output, you can run the following command in terminal and visit http://localhost:8000/rss.xml

```
gatsby build && gatsby serve
```
