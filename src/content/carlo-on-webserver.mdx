[Carlo](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/carlo) is a headful Node app framework for building desktop applications.

### How is it different from Electron, Proton Native?

While these other frameworks, bring their own runtime into the equation, Carlo uses the Chrome instance already installed on a users computer.

### Why would you want it on a web server?

Using webpack to bundle all your files makes it easier to use the developer ecosystem that the javascript community already provides. Like Babel, SCSS or ESLint.

### What is about to be assumed?

You already know how to setup a normal webpack server.

### Is there a shortcut?

Yes, [Electrojet CLI](https://github.com/agneym/create-electrojet) provides a single command to setup a carlo project using webpack:

```bash
  npm init electrojet <project-name> --template=carlo
```

### How do I set Carlo to listen to the webpack dev server?

Carlo has an API [`serveOrigin`](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/carlo/blob/master/API.md#appserveoriginbase-prefix) to listen to a particular web address as origin. You can use that with:

```js
carlo.launch().then(async (app) => {
  app.on("exit", () => process.exit());
  app.serveOrigin("http://localhost:8080"); // Point to webpack url here
  await app.load("index.html");
});
```

But then, you would soon find that your javascript bundle is not loading.

### What is the problem?

Carlo, currently on version 0.9, allows to serve origin contents only when they are from secure origins, which means if you try to setup a normal webpack server to serve the application you would end up with:

```bash
Blocked by the Client
```

in the console while serving the application.

Fortunately, if you are using webpack dev server, the solution to this is easy. Inside the configuration object for `devServer` provide:

```js
{
  devServer: {
    ...otherOptions
    http: true,
  }
}
```

But this would pull up the nasty `Your webpack is not secure` screen for you, when you are not even running it on a webpage.

Luckily, Carlo provides an API to escape this dreaded screen. On launching the carlo server, you can provide `args: ["--allow-insecure-localhost"],` to avoid seeing the screen ever again.

```js
carlo.launch({
  ...otherOptions
  args: ["--allow-insecure-localhost"],
})
```

You should have your server up and running now.
